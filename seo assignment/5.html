Qs :
Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.

Ans :
<!-- A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, usually square image that is associated with a website and is displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other places. Favicons serve as a visual representation of a website and help users easily identify and remember the site.
Here's an illustrative example of how to include a favicon in an HTML document:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="Your concise and descriptive meta description goes here. This is a brief summary of your webpage content.">
    
    <!-- Your title should be descriptive and include relevant keywords -->
    <title>Descriptive and Optimized Title for Your Webpage</title>
    
    <!-- Favicon link (replace 'favicon.ico' with your actual favicon file) -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <!-- Additional meta tags, stylesheets, scripts, or other head elements can be included here -->

</head>

<body>
    <!-- Your webpage content goes here -->

    <!-- Scripts or additional body elements can be included here -->

</body>

</html>


<!-- In this example:

- The `<link>` tag with the `rel` attribute set to "icon" establishes a link between the HTML document and the favicon.
- The `href` attribute specifies the path to the favicon file. In this case, it's set to "favicon.ico." Replace this with the actual path to your favicon file.

Favicons are typically small images, often in the ICO (Icon) format, though other image formats like PNG are also commonly used. The size of a favicon is usually 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels. Including a favicon in your website not only enhances its visual identity but also contributes to a more professional and recognizable user experience. -->
